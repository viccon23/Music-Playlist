# Music-Playlist

This program represents a basic implementation of a playlist management system in C++

 Two structure objects are created, called "Song" and "Track". "Song" represents a single song with properties such as song title, artist/s, genre/s, album, and length. "Track" represents a song in the context of a playlist, with additional properties like favorite status and pointers to the next and previous tracks.
  
  Upon executing the program, a menu will display where the user can choose between 9 different options. The program provides member functions within the "Playlist" struct to perform various operations on the playlist, such as adding a track, removing tracks, toggling favorite status, inserting a track at a specific position, displaying the playlist, and searching by genre. Each menu option corresponds to a specific operation and interacts with the "Playlist" object accordingly, including input validation to check for error handling, such as checking for empty playlists or invalid input.
